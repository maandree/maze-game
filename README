Maze solving game

This program does not concern itself to much
about generating mazes, although it offers a
simple generator, rather it provides a
comfortable interface for solving them, and
lets you specify the a file with a maze, which
can be a output file from another program.

Use the arrow keys to move around, hold down
control to move to next turn or shift or
alternative to move to next wall.

Maze files must have one opening on the left
edge and one opening on the right edge, but
no additional openings.
Walls in maze files are repesented by a hash
(#) and floor is represented by dot (.).
